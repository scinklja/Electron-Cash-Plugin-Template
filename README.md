Its aim is to help people drop fiat and use BCH instead, by alleviating following issues:

1. marketing - by being able to demonstrate how much profit one gains by switching from fiat to bch as a primary currency.
2. volatility - by being able to easily see if it is time to accumulate (negative unrealized profit) or spend.
3. merchant inflows - by increasing the amount of consumers holding BCH for the purpose of spending.  



The plugin is not intended to calculate profit for tax purposes.
